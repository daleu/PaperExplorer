Version to appear in Ann. Phys UB-ECM-PF 93/18, TOHO-FP-9449 Annals Phys. 244 (1995) 67-100\\  We introduce a particle mechanics model with Sp($2M$) gauge invariance.Different partial gauge-fixings by means of sl(2) embeddings on the gaugealgebra lead to reduced models which are invariant under diffeomorphisms andclassical non-linear \W-transformations as the residual gauge symmetries thusproviding a set of models of gauge and matter fields coupled in a \W-invariantway. The equations of motion for the matter variables give Lax operators in amatrix form. We examine several examples in detail and discuss the issue ofintegration of infinitesimal \W-transformations.

It isshown that the integral representations of both algebras are reduced to thosein a (1+1)-dimensional fermion. As an application of the quantum groupsymmetry, we discuss a model of quantum group current on the analogy of theHall current.

9402117  A Renormalization Group Flow Approach to Decoupling and Irrelevant  Operators Chanju Kim  Physics (Title was changed. Renormalization conditions on heavy fields were  changed to physical ones.) SNUTP-94-20 Ann. Phys. 243 (1995) 117\\  Using Wilson-Polchinski renormalization group equations, we give a simple newproof of decoupling in a $\phi^4$-type scalar field theory involving two realscalar fields (one is heavy with mass $M$ and the other light). Then, to allorders in perturbation theory, it is shown that effects of virtual heavyparticles up to the order $1/M^{2N_0}$ can be systematically incorporated intolight-particle theory via effective local vertices of canonical dimension atmost $4+2N_0$. The couplings for vertices of dimension $4+2N$ are of order$1/M^{2N}$ and are systematically calculable. All this is achieved throughintuitive dimensional arguments without resorting to complicated graphicalarguments or convergence theorems.

9503184  Quark Confinement and Dual Representation in 2+1 Dimensional Pure  Yang-Mills Theory Sumit R. Das and Spenta R. Wadia (Tata Institute) 26 pages, RevTex, Title changed, a new section added, the discussion  on stability of dressed monopole expanded. Version to appear in Physical  Review D TIFR-TH/94-42 Phys.Rev. D53 (1996) 5856-5865\\  We study the quark confinement problem in 2+1 dimensional pure Yang-Millstheory using euclidean instanton methods. The instantons are regularized anddressed Wu-Yang monopoles. The dressing of a monopole is due to the mean fieldof the rest of the monopoles. We argue that such configurations are stable tosmall perturbations unlike the case of singular, undressed monopoles. Usingexact non-perturbative results for the 3-dim. Coulomb gas, where Debyescreening holds for arbitrarily low temperatures, we show in a self-consistentway that a mass gap is dynamically generated in the gauge theory. The mass gapalso determines the size of the monopoles. In a sense the pure Yang-Millstheory generates a dynamical Higgs effect. We also identify the disorderoperator of the model in terms of the Sine-Gordon field of the Coulomb gas.

A11 (1996) 1-27\\  Odd time was introduced to formulate the Batalin-Vilkovisky method ofquantization of gauge theories in a systematic manner. This approach ispresented emphasizing the odd time canonical formalism beginning from an oddtime Lagrangian. To let the beginners have access to the method essentialnotions of the gauge theories are briefly discussed, and each step isillustrated with examples. Moreover, the method of solving the master equationin an easy way for a class of gauge theories is reviewed. When this method isapplicable some properties of the solutions can easily be extracted as shown inthe related examples.

LaTeX, 11 pages, no figures Phys.Lett. B366 (1996) 134\\  The equations of motion (e.m.'s) of the N=1, D=10 anomaly free supergravity,obtained in the framework of the superspace approach, are analyzed. The formalequivalence of the usual and dual supergravities is discussed at the level ofe.m.'s. The great simplicity of the dual formulation is established. Thepossibillity of the lagrangian formulation of the dual supergravity is pointedout. The bosonic part of the lagrangian is constructed including anomalycompensating superstring corrections.

9510172  Differential Geometry and Integrability of the Hamiltonian System of a  Closed Vortex Filament Norihito Sasaki Title is changed ('a' is added). A mistake (absence of stating  F-linearity condition of a skew-adjoint op., Sect.4) is corrected. One  reference is added. The other changes are minor. 12 pages, LaTeX OCU-157 High Energy Physics - Theory; Exactly Solvable and Integrable  Systems Lett.Math.Phys. 39 (1997) 229-241\\  The system of a closed vortex filament is an integrable Hamiltonian one,namely, a Hamiltonian system with an infinite sequense of constants of motionin involution. An algebraic framework is given for the aim of describingdifferential geometry of this system. A geometrical structure related to theintegrability of this system is revealed. It is not a bi-Hamiltonian structurebut similar one. As a related topic, a remark on the inspection of J.Langer andR.Perline, J.Nonlinear Sci.1, 71 (1991), is given.

B388 (1996) 487-493\\  We calculate the entropy of a scalar field in a rotating black hole in 2 + 1dimension. In the Hartle-Hawking state the entropy is proportional to thehorizon area, but diverges linearly in $\sqrt{h}$, where $h$ is the radialcut-off. In WKB approximation the superradiant modes do not contribute to theentropy.

Simon  have been added, one author has been suppressed, Title and abstract has been  modified, to appear in Nucl. Phys. B\\  Supersymmetry can be consistently generalized in one and two dimensionalspaces, fractional supersymmetry being one of the possible extension. 2Dfractional supersymmetry of arbitrary order $F$ is explicitly constructed usingan adapted superspace formalism. This symmetry connects the fractional spinstates ($0,{1 \over F}, ...,{F-1 \over F}$). Besides the stress momentumtensor, we obtain a conserved current of spin($1 + {1 \over F})$. The coherenceof the theory imposes strong constraints upon the commutation relations of themodes of the fields. The creation and annihilation operators turn out togenerate alternative statistics, currently referred as quons in the literature.We consider, with a special attention, the consistence of the algebra, on thelevel of the Hilbert space and the Green functions. The central charges aregenerally irrational numbers except for the particular cases $F=2,3,4$. Anatural classification emerges according to the decomposition of $F$ into itsproduct of prime numbers leading to sub-systems with smaller symmetries.

Title and  references modified. To appear in Nuclear Physics B. 21 pages, Latex High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Algebra Nucl.Phys. B486 (1997) 650-672\\  We extend our study of the field-theoretic description of matrix-vectormodels and the associated many-body problems of one dimensional particles withspin. We construct their Yangian-su(R) invariant Hamiltonian. It describes aninteracting theory of a c=1 collective boson and a k=1 su(R) current algebra.When $R \geq 3$ cubic-current terms arise. Their coupling is determined by therequirement of the Yangian symmetry. The Hamiltonian can be consistentlyreduced to finite-dimensional subspaces of states, enabling an explicitcomputation of the spectrum which we illustrate in the simplest case.

Rev. A UT-771, IU-MSTP/19 High Energy Physics - Theory; Chemical Physics Phys.Rev. A56 (1997) 3436-3445\\  A field dependent $su(2)$ gauge transformation connects between the adiabaticand diabatic pictures in the (Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg) potential curvecrossing problem. It is pointed out that weak and strong potential curvecrossing interactions are interchanged under this transformation, and thusrealizing a naive strong and weak duality. A reliable perturbation theoryshould thus be formulated in the both limits of weak and strong interactions.In fact, main characteristics of the potential crossing phenomena such as theLandau-Zener formula including its numerical coefficient are well-described bysimple (time-independent) perturbation theory without referring to Stokesphenomena. We also show that quantum coherence in a double well potential isgenerally suppressed by the effect of potential curve crossing, which isanalogous to the effect of Ohmic dissipation on quantum coherence.

Vitale  Title changed in journal to "The Quantum Poincare' Group as Hidden Symmetry  of General Relativity" UAHEP 9712, DSF-34/97 High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Algebra\\  Using the tools of q--differential calculus and quantum Lie algebrasassociated to quantum groups, we find a one--parameter family of q-gaugetheories associated to the quantum group $ISO_q(3,1)$. Although the gaugefields, that is the spin--connection and the vierbeins are non--commutingobjects depending on a deformation parameter, $q$, it is possible to constructout of them a metric theory which is insensitive to the deformation. TheChristoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor are ordinary commuting objects.Hence it is argued that torsionless Einstein's General Relativity is the commoninvariant sector of a one--parameter family of deformed gauge theories.

Comments, conclusions,  references, acknowledgments and report-no added JINR-E2-98-84 Mod.Phys.Lett. A13 (1998) 2571-2583\\  BRST quantization is carried out for a model of p-branes with second classconstraints. After extension of the phase space the constraint algebracoincides with the one of null string when p=1. It is shown that in this caseone can or can not obtain critical dimension for the null string, depending onthe choice of the operator ordering and corresponding vacuum states. When p>1,operator orderings leading to critical dimension in the p=1 case are notallowed. Admissable orderings give no restrictions on the dimension of theembedding space-time. Finally, a generalization to supersymmetric null branesis proposed.

B532 (1998) 210-226\\  We consider brane configurations in elliptic models which represent softlybroken N=4 USp(2 N_c) and SO(N_c) theory. We generalize the notion of the O4plane, so that it is compatible with the symmetry in the covering space of theelliptic models. By using this notion of the O4 plane, we find the curve forsoftly broken N=4 USp(2 N_c) and that for SO(N_c) theory as infinite seriesexpansions. For the USp case, we can present the expansion as a polynomial.

Title changed and introduction enlarged.  To be published in Eur. Phys. J. C Eur.Phys.J. C12 (2000) 701-705\\  We evaluate the one-loop fermion self-energy for the gauged Thirring model in(2+1) dimensions, with one massive fermion flavor, in the framework of thecausal perturbation theory. In contrast to QED$_3$, the corresponding two-pointfunction turns out to be infrared finite on the mass shell. Then, by means of aWard identity, we derive the on-shell vertex correction and discuss the roleplayed by causality for nonrenormalizable theories.

A IP/BBSR/98-23\\  We explicitly write down the invariant supersymmetry conditions for braneswith generic values of moduli and U-duality charges in various space-timedimensions $D \leq 10$. We then use these results to obtain new BPS states,corresponding to network type structure of such branes.

9807037  Quantum field theory Jifeng Yang(Fudan Univ., Shanghai, P. R. China)  Titled 'Can QFT be UV finite as well as effective?' at the XIth International  Conference, 'Problems of quantum field theory' held in JINR, Dubna, Russia,  July 13-17, 1998\\  A new attempt is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewedas the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory (thatis complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the modern standardpoint of view. This approach works for any interaction model and space-timedimension. It is much simpler in principle and in technology comparing to anyknown renormalization program.Unlike the known renormalization methods, theimportance of the procedure for defining the ambiguities (corresponding to thechoice of the renormalization conditions in the conventional program) is fullyappreciated in the new approach. It is shown that the high energy theory(s) orthe underlying theory(s) in fact 'stipulates (stipulate)' the low energy andeffective ones through these definitions within our approach while all theconventional methods miss this important point. Some simple but importantnonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility ofthe new approach. Other related issues (especially the IR problem and theimplication of our new approach for the canonical quantization procedure) arebriefly touched.

B444 (1998) 156-162\\  We show that the D-instanton in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background is awormhole connecting the background $AdS_5 \times S^5$ to the flat space $\bfR^{10}$ located at the position of the D-instanton. By a $SL(2,{\bf R})$rotation of type IIB theory, we can make the {\it global} geometry flat instring frame. We also find that, due to the tight relation between the dilatonand the axion, there is no $SL(2,{\bf R})$ element that takes strong stringcoupling to weak one without making the axion ill defined. We also discuss thecase of $AdS_3$ as well as the instanton gases. A subtlety on the D-instantonat the boundary or at the horizon is discussed.

Malik (Bose Centre, Calcutta, India) 20 pages, LaTeX, no figures, Title and text have been changed,  Journal reference is given, some references have been added Int. J. Mod. Phys. A15 (2000) 1685-1705\\  We discuss the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) cohomology and Hodgedecomposition theorem for the two dimensional free U(1) gauge theory. Inaddition to the usual BRST charge, we derive a local, conserved and nilpotentco(dual)-BRST charge under which the gauge-fixing term remains invariant. Weexpress the Hodge decomposition theorem in terms of these charges and theLaplacian operator. We take a single photon state in the quantum Hilbert spaceand demonstrate the notion of gauge invariance, no-(anti)ghost theorem,transversality of photon and establish the topological nature of this theory byexploiting the concepts of BRST cohomology and Hodge decomposition theorem. Infact, the topological nature of this theory is encoded in the vanishing of theLaplacian operator when equations of motion are exploited. On the twodimensional compact manifold, we derive two sets of topological invariants withrespect to the conserved and nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST charges and expressthe Lagrangian density of the theory as the sum of terms that are BRST- andco-BRST invariants. Mathematically, this theory captures together some of thekey features of both Witten- and Schwarz type of topological field theories.

9810017  Duality In Equations of Motion from Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Debashis Gangopadhyay 18 pages, Latex, Title changed, abstract rewritten, analogy to the  holographic principle stated, role of lambda clarified in a new section, a  new solution discussed, conclusion elaborated, references added and minorMod.Phys.Lett.A\\  Starting from lagrangian field theory and the variational principle, we showthat duality in equations of motion can also be obtained by introducingexplicit spacetime dependence of the lagrangian. Poincare invariance isachieved precisely when the duality conditions are satisfied in a particularway. The same analysis and criteria are valid for both abelian and nonabeliandualities. We illustrate how (1)Dirac string solution (2)Dirac quantisationcondition (3)t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole solutions and (4)a procedure emerges forobtaining {\it new} classical solutions of Yang-Mills (Y-M) theory. Moreover,these results occur in a way that is strongly reminiscent of the {\itholographic principle}.

Its physical consequencessuggest new ways of dealing with interactions, symmetries, Hawking-Unruhthermal properties and possibly also extensions of the scheme of renormalizedperturbation theory. Interactions are incorporated by using the fact that theS-matrix is a relative modular invariant of the interacting- relative to theincoming- net of wedge algebras. This new point of view allows many interestingcomparisions with the standard quantization approach to QFT and is shown to befirmly rooted in the history of QFT.

A15 (2000) 4739-4748\\  We investigate the issue of electromagnetic duality on the light front. Wework with Zwanziger's theory of electric and magnetic sources which isappropriate for treating duality. When quantized on the light-front in thelight front gauge, this theory yields two independent phase space degrees offreedom, namely the two transverse field components, the right number todescribe the gauge field sector of normal light-front QED and also theappropriate commutator between them. The electromagnetic duality transformationformulated in terms of them is similar in form to the Susskind transformationproposed for the free theory, provided one identifies them as the dynamicalfield components of the photon on the light-front in the presence of magneticsources. The Hamiltonian density written in terms of these components isinvariant under the duality transformation.

Malik (Bose Centre, Calcutta, India) 12 pages, LaTeX, no figures, Title and text have been slightly  changed, Journal reference is given and a reference has been added J. Phys. A\\  We discuss some aspects of cohomological properties of a two-dimensional freeAbelian gauge theory in the framework of BRST formalism. We derive theconserved and nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST charges and express the Hodgedecomposition theorem in terms of these charges and a conserved bosonic chargecorresponding to the Laplacian operator. It is because of the topologicalnature of free U(1) gauge theory that the Laplacian operator goes to zero whenequations of motion are exploited. We derive two sets of topological invariantswhich are related to each-other by a certain kind of duality transformation andexpress the Lagrangian density of this theory as the sum of terms that areBRST- and co-BRST invariants. Mathematically, this theory captures togethersome of the key features of Witten- and Schwarz type of topological fieldtheories.

9903136  Addenda and corrections to work done on the path-integral approach to  classical mechanics E.Gozzi, M.Regini Title changed, appendix expanded, few misprints fixed Phys.Rev.D 62 (2000) 067702 (shortened version)\\  In this paper we continue the study of the path-integral formulation ofclassical mechanics and in particular we better clarify, with respect toprevious papers, the geometrical meaning of the variables entering thisformulation. With respect to the first paper with the same title, we {\itcorrect} here the set of transformations for the auxiliary variables$\lambda_{a}$. We prove that under this new set of transformations theHamiltonian ${\widetilde{\cal H}}$, appearing in our path-integral, is an exactscalar and the same for the Lagrangian. Despite this different transformation,the variables $\lambda_{a}$ maintain the same operatorial meaning as before buton a different functional space. Cleared up this point we then show that thespace spanned by the whole set of variables ($\phi, c, \lambda,\bar c$) of ourpath-integral is the cotangent bundle to the {\it reversed-parity} tangentbundle of the phase space ${\cal M}$ of our system and it is indicated as$T^{\star}(\Pi T{\cal M})$. In case the reader feel uneasy with this strange{\it Grassmannian} double bundle, we show in this paper that it is possible tobuild a different path-integral made only of {\it bosonic} variables. Theseturn out to be the coordinates of $T^{\star}(T^{\star}{\cal M})$ which is thedouble cotangent bundle of phase-space.

9908052  Noncommutative Regularization for the Practical Man Eli Hawkins  EPS figures. Title explained in ref. [8] CGPG-99/8-2\\  It has been proposed that the noncommutative geometry of the "fuzzy" 2-sphereprovides a nonperturbative regularization of scalar field theories. Thisgeneralizes to compact Kaehler manifolds where simple field theories areregularized by the geometric quantization of the manifold.  In order to permit actual calculations and the comparison with otherregularizations, I describe the perturbation theory of these regularized modelsand propose an approximation technique for evaluation of the Feynman diagrams.I present example calculations of the simplest diagrams for the $\phi^4$ modelon the 2-sphere, a 2-sphere times a 2-sphere, and 2-dimensional complexprojective space.  This regularization fails for noncompact spaces; I give a brief dimensionalanalysis argument as to why this is so. I also discuss the relevance of thetopology of Feynman diagrams to their ultra-violet and infra-red divergencebehavior in this model.

Statements on non-renormalizability softened at the referee's request JHEP 0005 (2000) 037\\  A noncommutative Feynman graph is a ribbon graph and can be drawn on a genus$g$ 2-surface with a boundary. We formulate a general convergence theorem forthe noncommutative Feynman graphs in topological terms and prove it for someclasses of diagrams in the scalar field theories. We propose a noncommutativeanalog of Bogoliubov-Parasiuk's recursive subtraction formula and show that thesubtracted graphs from a class $\Omega_d$ satisfy the conditions of theconvergence theorem. For a generic scalar noncommutative quantum field theoryon $\re^d$, the class $\Omega_d$ is smaller than the class of all diagrams inthe theory. This leaves open the question of perturbative renormalizability ofnoncommutative field theories. We comment on how the supersymmetry can improvethe situation and suggest that a noncommutative analog of Wess-Zumino model isrenormalizable.

B477 (2000) 292-298\\  We derive a BPS-type bound for four-dimensional Born-Infeld action withconstant B field background. The supersymmetric configuration saturates thisbound and is regarded as an analog of instanton in U(1) gauge theory.Furthermore, we find the explicit solutions of this BPS condition. Thesesolutions have a finite action proportional to the instanton number andrepresent D(p-4)-branes within a Dp-brane although they have a singularity atthe origin. Some relations to the noncommutative U(1) instanton are discussed.

D62 (2000) 046001\\  We construct twisted quantum bundles and adjoint sections on noncommutative$T^4$, and investigate relevant D-brane bound states with non-Abelianbackgrounds. We also show that the noncommutative $T^4$ with non-Abelianbackgrounds exhibits SO$(4,4|Z)$ duality and via this duality we get a Moritaequivalent $T^4$ on which only D0-branes exist. For a reducible non-Abelianbackground, the moduli space of D-brane bound states in Type II string theorytakes the form $\prod_a (T^4)^{q_a}/S_{q_a}$.

We find exactagreement with the coefficient appearing in the Randall-Sundrum brane-worldproposal. This provides more evidence for the complementarity of the twopictures.

Spallucci  Q.Grav.; Title slightly changed, added disussions and references Class.Quant.Grav. 17 (2000) L97-L103\\  We consider an action for a closed, bosonic, p-brane, where the brane tensionis not an assigned parameter but rather it is induced by a maximal rank gaugep-form. This model is classically equivalent to the Nambu--Goto/Howe-Tuckermodel. We investigate how this classical equivalence can be implemented in thepath integral framework. For this purpose we adopt a ``first order''integration procedure over gauge p-forms and a ``shortened'' Fadeev-Popovprocedure.

A; Title changed; new paragraphs  added in Introduction and Conclusions J.Phys. A34 (2001) 1771-1783\\  We study the self-interaction effects for the Dirac particle moving in anexternal field created by static charges in (1+1)-dimensions. Assuming that thetotal electric charge of the system vanishes, we show that the asymptoticallylinearly rising part of the external potential responsible for nonexistence ofbound states in the external field problem without self-interaction iscancelled by the self-potential of the zero mode of the Dirac particle chargedensity. We derive the Dirac equation which includes the self-potential of thenon-zero modes and is nonlinear. We solve the spectrum problem in the case oftwo external positive charges of the same value and prove that the Diracparticle and external charges are confined in a stable system.

Phys. Lett. B501 (2001) 289-296\\  A new set of exact scattering matrices in 1+1 dimensions is proposed bysolving the bootstrap equations. Extending earlier constructions of colourvalued scattering matrices this new set has its colour structure associated tonon simply-laced Lie algebras. This in particular leads to a coupling ofdifferent affine Toda models whose fusing structure has to be matched in asuitable manner. The definition of the new S-matrices is motivated by thesemi-classical particle spectrum of the non simply-laced HomogeneousSine-Gordon (HSG) models, which are integrable perturbations of WZNW cosets. Inparticular, the S-matrices of the simply-laced HSG models are recovered as aspecial case.

Few discussions added.No change in the conclusion. Accepted for publication  In Physics Letters B Phys.Lett. B514 (2001) 109-113\\  The helicity flip of a spin-1/2 Dirac fermion interacting with a torsion-field endowed with a pseudo-tensorial extension is analysed. Taking the torsionto be represented by a Kalb-Ramond field, we show that there is a finiteamplitude for helicity flip for massive fermions. The lowest order contributionis proportional to the pseudo-tensor term.

Version that appeared on JHEP JHEP 0108 (2001) 012\\  The induced 4d gravity on a brane world is analyzed. The case of a thickbrane is considered and the unexpected appearance of a new threshold scale,much larger than the thickness scale is found. In cases of phenomenologicalinterest, this new length scale turns out to be in the submillimeter range. Theeffect of $R^2$ corrections, both in the bulk and on the brane, is alsostudied. It is shown that they introduce new threshold scales and may inducedrastic modifications to the leading behavior. A concrete string/D-branerealization of the induced gravity scenario is also presented.

A17 (2002) 631\\  Noncommutative algebra in planar quantum mechanics is shown to follow from 'tHooft's recent analysis on dissipation and quantization. The noncommutativityin the coordinates or in the momenta of a charged particle in a magnetic fieldwith an oscillator potential are shown as dual descriptions of the samephenomenon. Finally, noncommutativity in a fluid dynamical model, analogous tothe lowest Landau level problem, is discussed.

0107159  On string models with Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking Claudio A. Scrucca and Marco Serone v2  slightly changed, figure 2 corrected and a reference added CERN-TH/2001-183; SISSA-55/2001/EP JHEP 0110 (2001) 017\\  We construct a general class of chiral four-dimensional string models withScherk--Schwarz supersymmetry breaking, involving freely acting orbifolds. Thebasic ingredient is to combine an ordinary supersymmetry-preserving Z_Nprojection with a supersymmetry-breaking projection Z_M' acting freely on asubspace of the internal manifold. A crucial condition is that any generator ofthe full orbifold group Z_N x Z_M' must either preserve some supersymmetry oract freely in order to become irrelevant in some large volume limit. Tachyonsare found to be absent or limited to a given region of the tree-level modulispace. We find several new models with orthogonal supersymmetries preserved atdistinct fixed-points. Particular attention is devoted to an interesting Z_3 xZ_3' heterotic example.

Title changed,  improvements on presentation, some typos corrected. Accepted for publication ITP Budapest Report No. 573 Nucl.Phys. B622 (2002) 565-592\\  We examine the spectrum and boundary energy in boundary sine-Gordon theory,based on our recent results on the complete spectrum predicted by closing theboundary bootstrap. We check the spectrum and the reflection factors againsttruncated conformal space, together with a (still unpublished) prediction byAl.B. Zamolodchikov for the boundary energy and the relation between theparameters of the scattering amplitudes and of the perturbed CFT Hamiltonian.In addition, we give a derivation of Zamolodchikov's formulae. We find anentirely consistent picture and strong evidence for the validity of theconjectured spectrum and scattering amplitudes, which together give a completedescription of the boundary sine-Gordon theory on mass shell.

Conclusions unchanged Class.Quant.Grav. 19 (2002) 2525-2527\\  We show how to derive systematically new forms of the BRST transformationsfor a generic gauge fixed action. They arise after a symmetry of the gaugefixed action is found in the sector involving the Lagrange multiplier and itscanonical momentum.

SNS-PH/01-08 Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 106002\\  A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally smallvalue of the cosmological constant $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120}$ measured in naturalPlanckian units. Here we derive this tiny number from a toroidal stringcosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy arises fromthe correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances hasan exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta.The freeze-out bythe expansion of the background universe for these transplanckian modes may beinterpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the threenon-compactified spatial dimensions.

0111232  Chiral Symmetry and Meson Vertex Operators in QCD Strings Vikram Vyas 12 Pages, LaTex. v2  discussion, an error corrected and a reference added\\  The worldline representation of the one loop fermionic effective action isused to obtain the vertex operator for the pion and the sigma in QCD strings.The vertex operator of the scalar sigma is distinguished from that of thepseudo-scalar pion by the presence of an additional operator m V_{0} where m isthe current quark mass and V_{0} is a vertex operator that would describe atachyon in the open bosonic string theory. This leads to a relation between thesigma propagator and the pion propagator, when chiral symmetry is spontaneouslybroken this relation implies that the propagator constructed from V_{0} mustbehave like a massless ghost state. The presence of this state ensures that thesigma is massive and no longer degenerate with the pion. The expectation valueof V_{0} in a string description is related to the vacuum expectation value ofthe chiral condensate in QCD. Our analysis emphasizes the need for boundaryfermions in any string representation of mesons and is suggestive of worldsheet supersymmetry.

0112108  Complex Angular Momentum Diagonalization of the Bethe-Salpeter Structure  in General Quantum Field Theory J. Bros (CEA/Saclay, SPhT, France), G.A. Viano (Istituto Nazionale di  Henri Poincar\'e Title change. New presentation. See//www-spht.cea.fr/articles/T01/119 SPhT-T01/119 High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics\\  The Complex Angular Momentum (CAM) representation of (scalar) four-pointfunctions has been previously established starting from the general principlesof local relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Here, we carry out thediagonalization of the general $t$-channel Bethe--Salpeter (BS) structure offour point functions in the corresponding CAM variable $\lambda_{t},$ for allnegative values of the squared-energy variable $t$. This diagonalization isclosely related to the existence of BS-equations for the absorptive parts inthe crossed channels, interpreted as convolution equations with spectralproperties. The production of Regge poles equipped with factorized residuesinvolving Euclidean three-point functions appears as conceptually built-in inthe analytic axiomatic framework of QFT. The existence of leading Reggeon termsgoverning the asymptotic behaviour of the four-point function at fixed $t$ isstrictly conditioned by the asymptotic behaviour of a global Bethe-Salpeterkernel of the theory.

0112159  A proposal for a first class conversion formalism based on the  symmetries of the Wess-Zumino terms J. Ananias Neto, C. Neves and W. Oliveira Revised version. Title changed for Gauging by symmetries. To appear  in IJMPA DF-UFJF-2001-05\\  We propose a new procedure to embed second class systems by introducingWess-Zumino (WZ) fields in order to unveil hidden symmetries existent in themodels. This formalism is based on the direct imposition that the new Hamiltonian must be invariant by gauge-symmetry transformations. Aninteresting feature in this approach is the possibility to find arepresentation for the WZ fields in a convenient way, which leads to preservethe gauge symmetry in the original phase space. Consequently, thegauge-invariant Hamiltonian can be written only in terms of the originalphase-space variables. In this situation, the WZ variables are only auxiliarytools that permit to reveal the hidden symmetries present in the original thereduced-SU(2) Skyrme model, the Chern-Simons-Proca quantum mechanics and thechiral bosons field theory. In all these systems, the gauge-invariantHamiltonians are derived in a very simple way.

Rev. D Phys.Rev. D66 (2002) 045031\\  Covariant quantization of the Nambu-Goto spinning particle in 2+1-dimensionsis studied. The model is relevant in the context of recent activities innon-commutative space-time. From a technical point of view also covariant the set of second classconstraints (in the Dirac classification scheme) is {\it reducible}. The (i) theauxiliary variable method [bn] and (ii) the projection operator method [blm].Finally in the former scheme, a Batalin-Tyutin quantization has been done. Thisinduces a mapping between the non-commutative and the ordinary space-time. BRSTquantization programme in the latter scheme has also been discussed.

0204075  The strength of small-instanton amplitudes in gauge theories with  compact extra dimensions E. Poppitz and Y. Shirman Title modified, references added, typos corrected. Version to appear  in JHEP. 24 pages, 1 figure CALT-68-2380, UPTP-02-02 JHEP 0207 (2002) 041\\  We study instanton effects in theories with compact extra dimensions. Weperform an instanton calculation in a 5d theory on a circle of radius R, withgauge, scalar, and fermion fields in the bulk of the extra dimension. We showthat, depending on the matter content, instantons of size rho << R can dominatethe amplitude. Using deconstruction as an ultraviolet definition of the theoryallows us to show, in a controlled approximation, that for a small number ofbulk fermions, the amplitude for small size instantons exponentially grows ase^{O(1)R/rho}.

To appear in Physics Letters B IMSc/2002/04/08\\  We study the dynamical features of Maggiore's generalised commutationrelations. We focus on their generality and, in particular, their dependence onthe Hamiltonian H. We derive the generalisation of the Planck's law for blackbody spectrum, study the statistical mechanics of free particles, and study theearly universe evolution which now exhibits non trivial features. We find thatthe dynamical features, found here and in our earlier work, are all generic andvary systematically with respect to the asymptotic growth of the Hamiltonian H.

Equation corrected AIP Conf.Proc. 646 (2003) 130-138\\  A nonlocal quantum gravity theory is presented which is finite and unitary toall orders of perturbation theory. Vertex form factors in Feynman diagramsinvolving gravitons suppress graviton and matter vacuum fluctuation loops byintroducing a low-energy gravitational scale, Lambda_{Gvac} < 2.4 X 10^{-3} eV.Gravitons coupled to non-vacuum matter loops and matter tree graphs arecontrolled by a vertex form factor with the energy scale, Lambda_{GM} < 1-10TeV. A satellite Eotvos experiment is proposed to test a violation of theequivalence principle for coupling of gravitons to pure vacuum energy comparedto matter.

V 2  modified; a few references and an acknowledgement added IMSc/2003/04/05\\  We obtain the asymptotic density of open p-brane states with zero-modesincluded. The resulting logarithmic correction to the p-brane entropy has acoefficient - \frac{p + 2}{2 p}, and is independent of the dimension of theembedding spacetime. Such logarithmic corrections to the entropy, with a gas ofmassless particles in p-dimensional space, and a Schwarzschild black hole in (p+ 2)-dimensional anti de Sitter spacetime.
